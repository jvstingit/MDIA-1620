--------------------
This is an *AWESOME* repository
--------------------
**AHA** moments
Figuring out the map of steps to navigate a file from its folder within Terminal
Markup Cheat Sheet website guide
Figuring out that Mat likes tasty sandwiches and doesn't have a bland palette
--------------------
**UNCLEAR** things
what exactly is github and what are we using it for? Is it a website thing or an app thing or for making a certain component of these interfaces? 

*****ANSWER: basically it CAN be used as a notepad so our instructor can view our code. But it's mainly to view changes and using it as a save area in order to refer back. Git hub is *not* a programming language. Markdown is a language *within* github.

Would terminal be more so a station for navigating or will we learn other commands that allow us to alter certain aspects of our interface? I understand it can alter files but how about the UI itself? 

ANSWER: Yes, we can do things beyond file navigation.

*ENTHUSIASTIC*
--------------------
NOTEs
-Benefits of github (graphical user interface)--> A ui to see version control changes. Don't need to view all changes in command line, easier visual to view the changes. 
-VSC has nothing to do with version control

**LAB 2**

*3 THINGS I LEARNED*
1- I learned about the importance of something that seems negligible but isn't--> spaces and capitalization. My git commit hadn't worked at first due to not having ONE SINGLE SPACE between the dash and the letter m which gave an incorrect output.
2- Boolean is a primitive used only for logical data and can only be answered using true or false. However! The camelCase question itself must make sense and have a word that directs into answering into true or false.
3- Node is used to run our javascript files and is activated through terminal WIHTOUT opening an actual NODE application.

*2 CONFUSING THINGS*
1- How come on Microsoft's CMD Prompt, the pop up login for github didn't open? Was there a prompt we could have typed to log into github from the terminal?
2- I am still a little confused on what exactly a commit is, what other word would you use to describe a commit?

**1 WORD FOR HOW I'M FEELING**
