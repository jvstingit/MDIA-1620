--------------------
This is an *AWESOME* repository

**AHA* moments
Figuring out the map of steps to navigate a file from its folder within Terminal
Markup Cheat Sheet website guide
Figuring out that Mat likes tasty sandwiches and doesn't have a bland palette

**UNCLEAR** things
what exactly is github and what are we using it for? Is it a website thing or an app thing or for making a certain component of these interfaces? 

*****ANSWER: basically it CAN be used as a notepad so our instructor can view our code. But it's mainly to view changes and using it as a save area in order to refer back. Git hub is *not* a programming language. Markdown is a language *within* github.

Would terminal be more so a station for navigating or will we learn other commands that allow us to alter certain aspects of our interface? I understand it can alter files but how about the UI itself? 

ANSWER: Yes, we can do things beyond file navigation.

*ENTHUSIASTIC*
--------------------
NOTEs
-Benefits of github (graphical user interface)--> A ui to see version control changes. Don't need to view all changes in command line, easier visual to view the changes. 
-VSC has nothing to do with version control
